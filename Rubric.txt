AP Computer Science Final Project Rubric

Students will be working in pairs to write graphical game in JAVA.  Your group may choose from one of the games listed below.

Pixie Roundup
Mine Sweeper
Battleship
Backgammon	Tetris
Checkers
Chess
A pre-approved game of your chosing

The following elements are required in this project:

1.	You must have researched and used some algorithmic class or commands not taught in this class. (NEW Commands
	that you have not been taught previously in Computer Science classes) They must be unique from what other students are using. Let Ms. Roszko know what they are so that no one can copy from you.
2.	Video buffering must be used in this game so that the pieces on the board do not interfere with the background.
3.	A Grid Layout must be used somewhere in the game. (it could be at the beginning of the game giving the user the
	choice of which game to choose)
4.	A Radio Button or a Check Box must be used in the game. (Radio button could signify the level of the gameâ€¦easy,
	normal, difficult) 
5.	A pull-down box must be used in the game (could be used for choosing the font)
6.	This must be either a one or two player game.
7.	A running score must be kept in most games.
8.	The game must be done using the mouse only (except Tetris may use the keyboard)
9.	There must be animation of some type in the game.


The game will be due on May 31st.  You may use the textbooks on the front table to research some of the commands you will need, however, do not remove them from the room.
